# *RBAC System - Admin Dashboard*

## *Overview*

Welcome to the *Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System*! This admin dashboard allows administrators to effectively manage users, assign roles, define permissions, and ensure security in a user-friendly, dynamic interface. The goal is to provide a smooth and efficient way to handle users, roles, and permissions, ensuring both flexibility and security.

### *Key Features:*

- *User Management:*  
  Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) users easily. Admins can assign roles, activate/deactivate users, and view user details.

- *Role Management:*  
  Define and manage roles with customizable permissions (Read, Write, Delete, etc.). Create roles with unique attributes to fit your organizational needs.

- *Dynamic Permissions Management:*  
  Assign permissions to roles dynamically and modify them as necessary. Permissions are displayed clearly for ease of use.

- *Responsive UI:*  
  Fully responsive UI built with *ReactJS* and *TailwindCSS*, providing a seamless experience across all devices.

- *Mock API Simulation:*  
  Simulated API calls to mock server responses for CRUD operations on users and roles.

---

## *Tech Stack:*

- *Frontend:* ReactJS, TailwindCSS, Vite
- *Backend (Mock Simulation):* Simulated API calls with mock data (JSON)
- *UI Design:* TailwindCSS for utility-first design, ensuring a flexible and responsive layout.

## *Core Functionalities:*

### 1. *User Management:*
   - *Add User:* Admins can add users with roles.
   - *Edit User:* Update user details, including roles and status (Active/Inactive).
   - *Delete User:* Remove users from the system.
   - *Assign Roles:* Assign multiple roles to users and control their access.
   
### 2. *Role Management:*
   - *Create Roles:* Define new roles with custom attributes and permissions.
   - *Edit Roles:* Modify roles as per requirement.
   - *Role Permissions:* Set read, write, delete, or custom permissions for each role.
   
### 3. *Permissions:*
   - *View Permissions:* Easily view which permissions are assigned to each role.
   - *Edit Permissions:* Modify permissions for roles without affecting users directly.

### 4. *Mock API Simulation (Optional):*
   - Simulate API responses for CRUD operations.
   - Validate functionality without needing an actual backend.

## *Other Stuffs:*

- *Creativity and Design Quality:*  
  I’ve prioritized visual appeal and clarity in designing a user-friendly, intuitive UI that aligns with RBAC principles while adding custom enhancements for an optimal experience.
  
- *Responsiveness:*  
  The dashboard is responsive and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

- *Functionality:*  
  Full implementation of RBAC concepts such as user management, dynamic permissions handling, and role assignments. 

- *User Experience (UX):*  
  Intuitive workflows for administrators. Tasks like adding users, editing roles, and assigning permissions are straightforward and quick.

- *Security Practices:*  
  Basic input validation and error handling to ensure secure operations. This is especially important for CRUD actions and permission modifications.

- *Additional Features:*  
  - *Search & Filter:* Easily search and filter through users and roles.
  - *Sorting:* Sort users and roles by various parameters like name, role, and status.
  - *Modals & Inline Editing:* For a more interactive and modern experience.
